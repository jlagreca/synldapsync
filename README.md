Extensible Synergetic to Active Directory Sync Tool in Python3

This tool aims to achieve the following scenario:
- Synergetic is the primary data source for staff, students, and parents.
- Manage Active Directory accounts based on rules (will require attribute mapping to the synergy ID).
- Manage printing credentials for systems like PaperCut MF (write unique ID's to Active Directory).
- Manage Exchange mailboxes based on rules.
- Integrate with third party systems like Alaress' Schoolbox Intranet Solution via an extensible system.
